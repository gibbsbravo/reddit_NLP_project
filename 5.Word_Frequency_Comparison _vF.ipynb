       "      <td>**mutualism (economic theory)** mutualism is an economic theory and anarchist school of thought that advocates a society where each person might possess a means of production, either individually or in purely voluntary collectives, with trade representing equivalent amounts of labor in the free market. integral to the scheme is the establishment of a mutual-credit bank that would lend to producers at a minimal interest rate, just high enough to cover administration. mutualism is based on a labor theory of value that holds that when labor or its product is sold, in exchange it ought to receive goods or services embodying \"the amount of labor necessary to produce an article of exactly similar and equal utility\". mutualism originated from the writings of philosopher pierre-joseph proudhon. *** **market socialism** market socialism is a type of economic system involving the public, cooperative or social ownership of the means of production in the framework of a market economy. market socialism differs from non-market socialism in that the market mechanism is utilized for the allocation of capital goods and the means of production. depending on the specific model of market socialism, profits generated by socially owned firms (i.e. net revenue not reinvested into expanding the firm) may variously be used to directly remunerate employees, accrue to society at large as the source of public finance or be distributed amongst the population in a social dividend. *** **left-wing market anarchism** left-wing market anarchism, a form of left-libertarianism, individualist anarchism and libertarian socialism, is associated with contemporary scholars such as kevin carson, roderick t. long, charles johnson, brad spangler, sheldon richman, chris matthew sciabarra and gary chartier, who stress the value of radically free markets, termed freed markets to distinguish them from the common conception which these libertarians believe to be riddled with statist and capitalist privileges. referred to as left-wing market anarchists or market-oriented left-libertarians, proponents of this approach strongly affirm the classical liberal ideas of self-ownership and free markets, while maintaining that taken to their logical conclusions these ideas support anti-capitalist, anti-corporatist, anti-hierarchical, pro-labor positions in economics; anti-imperialism in foreign policy; and thoroughly radical views regarding such cultural issues as gender, sexuality and race. the genealogy of contemporary market-oriented left-libertarianism – sometimes labeled \"left-wing market anarchism\" – overlaps to a significant degree with that of steiner–vallentyne left-libertarianism as the roots of that tradition are sketched in the book the origins of left-libertarianism. carson–long-style left-libertarianism is rooted in 19th-century mutualism and in the work of figures such as thomas hodgskin and the individualist anarchists benjamin tucker and lysander spooner. *** ^[ [^pm](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=wikitextbot&amp;amp;message=excludeme&amp;amp;subject=excludeme) ^| [^exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/libertarian/about/banned) ^| [^faq ^/ ^information](https://np.reddit.com/r/wikitextbot/wiki/index) ^| [^source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/wikitextbot) ^| [^donate](https://www.reddit.com/r/wikitextbot/wiki/donate) ^] ^downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28</td>\n",

       "270    but antifa are not stormtroppers (or, more propertly sa, sturmabteilung). stormtroopers are what we call special forces today: highly trained and armed. the sa was the paramilitary arm of the nazi party, sent out to beat up political opponents. antifa are anarchists who think they can set the world on fire and so build something better in the ashes. ideologically they are closer in some ways to libertarians than they are to democrats. now i want to be clear about this. i think that in many ways libertarianism is ideologically incoherent. that is, there are dozens of different views that are under the umbrella libertarian. one of them is the nap non-violent side. another is the anarchist no hierarchy tear it down side. these should not be considered one group but you are all such small groups to split more leaves nothing left.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

       "2030   it's a shame to see some people are so taken in by the \"collectivism\" versus \"individualism\" dichotomy while ignoring psychological, philosophical, sociological and psychoanalytical research into the course of history and the nature of man. these terms are not sufficient to describe the operation of systems or people. some socialists such as oscar wilde argued that socialism was the epitome of individualism, the release of man from the will of the collective system of the market. others, such as individualist social anarchist max stirner argued along similar lines, for a society organised along voluntary unions of egoists, doing away with property as a meaningful dimension of society. please don't confuse individualism with property ownership.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "2234   i don't think you understand what the neo in neo-nazi means. when these people throw a nazi salute it's not because they're really into hilter's ideas on the role of government and economic policy. they are selective, more interested with whether or not jews and black people should be in ovens. so there is no reason that chris cantwell can't be a white supremacist and an anarcho-capitalist.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

       "2460   not an argument. even anarchism has voluntary safeguards. libertarians are not pacifists and a society dedicated to protecting private property wouldn't even allow communists in. they'd do it via discrimination or by contract law societies, likely both. say if one were to publicly advocate communism, you could exclude them from your shops, power companies from service, utility companies with basic living services and grocery stores with food. one may break the blockade but will still charge high prices to the communist because they can. the communist will be forced to move and no force was initiated. this is how you would prevent your society from being subverted.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",

       "2732   i feel like only about 30% of the people who post here are libertarian to any degree. i am not even talking about anarchism or minarchism. i am using just classical liberal as as the baseline. maybe it is good thing that this forum attracts so many viewpoints. maybe more people will get some exposure to good ideas. i don't know. but it would be nice if every thread weren't overrun by cancerous leftists.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",

       "82920  i dont see why your taking so much flak for this. you can be in favor of a strong military that is disallowed from acting within the nations borders to enforce laws and still be a libertarian. libertarian doesnt mean anarchist                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "82929  libertarianism is far more broad. i'm probably going to over simplify this - i somewhat jokingly self-identify as an \"illiterate anarchist,\" since i'm not the most well-read person, as far as the theory goes - but libertarianism promotes the absolutism of individual liberty. anarchism is the rejection of the necessity of hierarchy, which libertarianism doesn't necessarily do: most libertarians on the right - and plenty of people on the left as well - will tell you that there are natural, justified or acceptable hierarchies that allow society to be more efficient, productive, etc. they don't see the abolition of hierarchy as a necessity, as so long as they do not interfere with your individual freedoms, they are not hurting you. anarchists argue that hierarchy is something that is forced upon humanity, ie, not voluntary, and as such, is antithetical to liberty.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
       "83056  it does not really matter: * to my mind a right-wing anarchist is just a minarchist who’d abolish the state to his own satisfaction by calling it something else. but this incestuous family squabble is no affair of mine. *both camps call for partial or complete privatization of state functions but neither questions the functions themselves.* **they don’t denounce what the state does, they just object to who’s doing it.** this is why the people most victimized by the state display the least interest in libertarianism. those on the receiving end of coercion don’t quibble over their coercers’ credentials. if you can’t pay or don’t want to, you don’t much care if your deprivation is called larceny or taxation or restitution or rent. *if you like to control your own time, you distinguish employment from enslavement only in degree and duration.* -bob black --- granted, as a left-lib, i jump the fence between the idealistic and the realistic. idealistically, i'm a hardcore anarchist; anti-capitalism and anti-state for the same reasons. bricks through starbucks windows, black masks, mohawk in my olden days. realistically, i'm more of a left-minarchist. i believe that if we are to have a minimal and common sense government, it should be for the support of the people not businesses and property. the concern of the government should be for caring for the least of us, primarily through education, healthcare, and infrastructure. police, courts, and military are the biggest parts of big government so i don't see how any \"minarchist\" can be supportive of the biggest parts of big government. well, i see how; they just look at money spent, not what they do or their purpose. a teacher is no threat, a cop is. a librarian cannot oppress me, the courts do that. that's big government, the part with the guns.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",

       "83426  thanks for the detailed reply. as i suspected, the professional response to my comment above is not that it is \"wrong\" but that history is more complicated than my simplified summary. i'll address a few points. &gt; this is not true. m.t. clanchy, in his groundbreaking and canonical book from memory to written record in england, focuses on the years from 1066-1307. i hope that time frame is \"medieval\" enough for you. it is not. i was thinking primarily in the fifth to ninth centuries, during the slow collapse of roman imperial structures particularly in n. europe, the period marked by the plague of justinian, the mass migration and settlement of germanic peoples, volkerwanderung, the collapse of trade, depopulation of cities, the disappearance of literacy, bureaucracy, coastal shipping, currency, the displacement of latin etc. this was a period of innumerable small wars and conquests, well before the appearance of organized kingdoms like alfred of wessex, the anglo-saxons, the normans etc. this was the period during which the holdings that would eventually become feudal estates were conquered, settled, established. that period more or less exactly matches my description above: decentralized, little bureaucracy, few written laws, and nearly all functions of law and the state carried out in the form of personal relationships between kings, lords and vassals. it wouldn't be accurate to describe this period as some kind of pure, lawless anarchy... but it was about as close to pure, lawless anarchy as europe ever came after the roman period. of course by the high middle ages the settlements and landholdings had evolved into estates controlled by dynastic family or clan arrangements. traditions of law and bureaucracy had begun to spring up in order to support the somewhat more organized kingdoms that began stitching these dynastic holdings together into economic and cultural entities that would eventually transform the idea of a \"kingdom\" into the idea of a \"nation\". but even at that point by the 9th century, it's important to look not only at the fact that written laws and primitive state organs were springing up, but also at *who was running them*. yes there were courts of law, courts of anglo-saxon law, courts of norman law, etc. but who was administering those courts? who were the judges? who were the legislators? the answer of course is that noble landholders either served as judges themselves or controlled the people who did. in england for example, manorial courts had considerable power over villeins, while hundredcourts had wider jurisdiction over freeholders. but large landholding aristocratic families controlled most of the hundreds. in the various regions of france, landholding aristocrats had if anything even more power over the administration of law. the development of a professional class of judges and attorneys who were either agents of the king or quasi independent evolved relatively slowly over centuries. but in a very real sense for much of the middle ages, the law was whatever large, landowning aristocratic families said it was. if your point is that europe reached a point of maximum illiteracy and decentralization in roughly 700-800, and then slowly built new structures of law and bureaucracy over the following centuries, i can accept that. that pretty much accords with my thinking, although it's more nuanced than my original comment.                                                          \n",
       "83474  &gt; the author's view's aren't necessarily relevant to the character. for example malcolm reynolds, of firefly/serenity, is anarcho-capitalist, but the author, joss whedon, says he is basically the opposite. v is an anarchist though and traditionally speaking anarchists are left-wing , it would be weird if he was an anarcho-capitalist. seeing how they have authoritarian views when it comes to hierarchy and power. as i see a lot of anarcho-capitalists being sympathetic to fascism and rothbard was too. &gt; american libertarians are fine with homosexuality. the difference with left-libertarians is economic, not social. it's been a while since i have watched the movie, but i don't recall v making comments about his economic views. he could be either \"left\" or \"right.\" in the comics he explains he is a anarchist in the political sense, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/v_(comics)the_\"villain\" &gt; have you seen a nolan chart? it was invented by david nolan, the founder of the libertarian party in america. the top of the chart is libertarian. for the bottom of the chart, opposite libertarian, nolan originally used the term \"populist\", but it has used various labels over the years, including \"statist\", \"authoritarian\", \"communitarian\", \"totalitarian\", and... \"fascist.\" it has never been labeled \"communist.\" yeah, but there are a lot of political charts. usually this one is used more though. you are also referencing a libertarian chart that doesnt label communism, but other charts label communism and fascism https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/political_spectrum/media/file:political_chart.svg https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/political_spectrum/media/file:politicalquad_en.svg                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

       "84231  **mutualism (economic theory)** mutualism is an economic theory and anarchist school of thought that advocates a society where each person might possess a means of production, either individually or in purely voluntary collectives, with trade representing equivalent amounts of labor in the free market. integral to the scheme is the establishment of a mutual-credit bank that would lend to producers at a minimal interest rate, just high enough to cover administration. mutualism is based on a labor theory of value that holds that when labor or its product is sold, in exchange it ought to receive goods or services embodying \"the amount of labor necessary to produce an article of exactly similar and equal utility\". mutualism originated from the writings of philosopher pierre-joseph proudhon. *** **market socialism** market socialism is a type of economic system involving the public, cooperative or social ownership of the means of production in the framework of a market economy. market socialism differs from non-market socialism in that the market mechanism is utilized for the allocation of capital goods and the means of production. depending on the specific model of market socialism, profits generated by socially owned firms (i.e. net revenue not reinvested into expanding the firm) may variously be used to directly remunerate employees, accrue to society at large as the source of public finance or be distributed amongst the population in a social dividend. *** **left-wing market anarchism** left-wing market anarchism, a form of left-libertarianism, individualist anarchism and libertarian socialism, is associated with contemporary scholars such as kevin carson, roderick t. long, charles johnson, brad spangler, sheldon richman, chris matthew sciabarra and gary chartier, who stress the value of radically free markets, termed freed markets to distinguish them from the common conception which these libertarians believe to be riddled with statist and capitalist privileges. referred to as left-wing market anarchists or market-oriented left-libertarians, proponents of this approach strongly affirm the classical liberal ideas of self-ownership and free markets, while maintaining that taken to their logical conclusions these ideas support anti-capitalist, anti-corporatist, anti-hierarchical, pro-labor positions in economics; anti-imperialism in foreign policy; and thoroughly radical views regarding such cultural issues as gender, sexuality and race. the genealogy of contemporary market-oriented left-libertarianism – sometimes labeled \"left-wing market anarchism\" – overlaps to a significant degree with that of steiner–vallentyne left-libertarianism as the roots of that tradition are sketched in the book the origins of left-libertarianism. carson–long-style left-libertarianism is rooted in 19th-century mutualism and in the work of figures such as thomas hodgskin and the individualist anarchists benjamin tucker and lysander spooner. *** ^[ [^pm](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=wikitextbot&amp;message=excludeme&amp;subject=excludeme) ^| [^exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/libertarian/about/banned) ^| [^faq ^/ ^information](https://np.reddit.com/r/wikitextbot/wiki/index) ^| [^source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/wikitextbot) ^| [^donate](https://www.reddit.com/r/wikitextbot/wiki/donate) ^] ^downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28  \n",

       "84684  yes, they now have a state, you dipshit. and [their quality of life improved](http://www.peterleeson.com/better_off_stateless.pdf) after their shitty state failed rather than before when they had a shitty state. you failed at even establishing the facts of the case, let alone making it somehow applicable to anarchism.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "84912  you're just throwing out labels. even libertarians believe in the idea of government; they aren't anarchists (at least most of them anyway). if you believe in government, then surely you believe in some way to fund it. there are lots of tax systems that have been proposed. general tariffs and flat taxes seem to be the most popular among libertarians.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
